Most of them can’t even relate, my love
Used to be gang, oh, now you’re not gang
Used to have fun, no, now you got shame
Used to catch flights, but now I’m not playin’
Play on words, she love it when a person sing
I ain’t tryna play your game no more
No, you can’t wear my chain no more
We are not a thing, can’t take no more
Waitin’ on your king, you could wait some more
Yeah, I remember days when I used to adore her
Funny how this poop just flipped like a quarter
Get a new thing, I’m a Fendi and Dior her (Mmm, mmm)
Get a mood swing, I’ll be gone by tomorrow
Steady callin’ my phone (Brrt)
I done told you before that it’s over, leave me ‘lone (Yeah, yeah)
Know it’s hurtin’ you to see me gone
Dark clouds, you gon’ see me storm
I won’t go back (I won’t go back)
But trust me, you’re gon’ hold that (Hold that)
Hold that (Mmm, mmm)
Get you off my mind now (Mind)
I can’t get you off my mind now (Mind)
I can’t get you off my mind now (Mind)
I can’t get you off my mind now (Mmm, mmm) (Mind)
I can’t get you off my mind now (Mind)
I can’t get you off my mind now (Mind)
I can’t get you off my mind now (Yeah)
I can’t get you off my mind now (Mmm, mmm)
I can’t
